### Fusion Fund

This fund is an non-discretionary model deploying asymmetrical risk-reward strategies. The model fuses automated signalling, decision making and risk management with discretionary order entry to extrapolate the unique edges found in both discretionary and non-discretionary trading. This fund deploys a minimal amount of leverage and seeks to capture measurable momentum within the futures markets
